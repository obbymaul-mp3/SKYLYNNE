# SKYLYNNE licensing

SKYLYNNE is free software under the GNU General Public License, version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`; the full text is in
`LICENSE`). That covers the firmware, the tools and the web pages in this tree. A few bundled parts keep their own
licences; their texts are in `LICENSES/`.

The firmware built from this tree is GPL-3.0-only as a whole. If you distribute it, you must also give your
recipients its complete corresponding source under the same licence.

## SKYLYNNE's own work

The sound engine, effects, scene renderer, physics sequencer, interface, browser version and web pages
(`firmware/src/sk_*.c`, `firmware/src/skylynne.c`, `tools/web/`, `web/`) are new work, GPL-3.0-only.

## The hardware layer

The FM-1 platform code (`firmware/hal`, `firmware/stub`, `firmware/loader`, the C runtime, the update loader and the
installer protocol) comes from **Felucca** by Leo Kuroshita (Hügelton Instruments,
<https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca>), through **ChoralRoot FM-1** by Quixotic7. It is GPL-3.0-only and keeps its
copyright lines in the source files. The small 2D text/LCD driver and C library routines (`lcd.c`, `libc.c`) are
from the same lineage.

## Third-party material
